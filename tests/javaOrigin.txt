hii hello 
the README.md files stopped working so I can't copy paste the origins of Java D:
From what I remember, it was created in 1991 and originally called Oak. 
Java was renamed as such due to coffee! I guess even 30+ years ago that developers were sleep depreived, dang :c

Actual Message:
The first version of Java was written in 1991.
It was initially called Oak after an oak tree that 
stood outside one of the founders offices, but
later renamed to Java after the Indonesian coffee.
